PROG :
	>Implement a queue using 2 stacks.

LOGIC : 
	>While we enqueue, we push in first stack.
	When we dequeue, we transfer all items from stack1 to stack2.
	NOW,henceforth, whenever we enqueue we push to stack1 and whenever we dequeue we pop from stack2
	If stack2 becomes NULL, then again we transfer all elements from stack1 to stack2.

	>I have implemented "double linked list" as stack.


DOUBT :
	>dequeue returns '0' if the stack is NULL,so we are not sure if stack2 is empty OR '0' is what 
	it wants to return. Dont know how to get rid of it.
